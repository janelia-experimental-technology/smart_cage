* Smart Cage Software Proposal

** Description

   Each SmartCage contains a mouse with a headbar, a tunnel module with latches
   and sensors, and a lickport module for dispensing water at different
   positions and sensing licks.

   A SmartCage runs a training period lasting approximately one month. One
   training session runs each day of the training period for part of the day.

** Lab Request

*** Matlab Bpod

    - integrate the existing Python and Matlab scripts
    - easily communicate between Matlab code (Bpod) and Python code (SmartCage)
      using the Robot Operating System (ROS)
    - create a GUI to quickly browse through/monitor all the mice training
      states
    - alarm systems to notify users when either component crashes or mice do not
      perform well
    - want to be able to have multiple mice automatically train themselves
    - want to monitor their health/training remotely 24/7

*** Python Bpod

    - provide example code showing the PyBpod scripts can control the SmartCage
      (e.g. lickport positions, latching) via ROS
    - alarm systems to notify users when either component crashes or mice do not
      peroform well
